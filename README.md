#CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete

For a job interview I was tasked to complete a CRUDdy program (ha! - pun). This program includes quite a few ingredients from basic to advanced PHP (maybe not so quite advanced):

* OOP (Object Oriented Programming) - with classes, instantiation, encapsulation.
* Control statements e.g. while and foreach loops, switch and case statements, as well as the basic if-then-else
* PDO/mysqli - using the built in PDO class and mysqli classes to connect to a MySQL database and run queries
* User Defined Functions - one function really, that performs form validation for the required filled in fields
* A global
* A few other things like use of the header function, cascading style sheets (CSS), a little recursion (not much really), and require_once function to include classes and a globals page -> to keep everything in one place for easy editing/readability.

Let's check it out!
